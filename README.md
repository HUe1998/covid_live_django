# covid_live
Website that displays live covid cases by country using Pie Chart. This is same as the previous project I did but now using Django. Link to my previous Node.js Implementation: https://github.com/HUe1998/covid_live.
<hr/> I have used the API available at https://api.covid19api.com/summary for data.
<hr/>
<!-- 
I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS to handle the backend. I have also used EJS to pass variables from NodeJS to HTML.
To make the Pie Chart, I used Chart.JS. Moreover, I had to provide colors for all the countries. To automate this task
I used Palette.js available here:<br/>
